# R-squared - % of the variance in our dependent variable (y) that can be explained by the model
# Can be read that as x increases by 1, y is affected by the returning variable coefficient number
# p_value < .05 means we reject the null hypothesis and the coefficient is statistically significant
# confidence interval [lower bound < 0 < upper bound] indicates we do not reject null hypothesis
