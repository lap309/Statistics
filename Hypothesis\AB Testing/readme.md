# Central Limit Theorem

#### Part 1: <br>
The distribution of sample means with replacement (from a greater population) will approximately be normally distributed as the sample size gets larger. This will hold true regardless of whether the source population is normal or skewed, provided the sample size is sufficiently large (usually n > 30). If the population distribution is normal, you donâ€™t need n>30

Ex: 	pop size N = 1000			Sample size n = 50 <br>
    	Pop mean = 150<br>
  	  Pop st_dev = 6<br>

All possible samples (with replacement) = 1000^ 50 <br>
1000 ^ 50 sample means will be in the distribution for CLT and that distribution will be normally distributed
The larger the sample size, the more normally distributed it will be. Why? 
Because if we increase the sample size, we have more values that will kind of even out the sample mean, and will get it closer to the average.

Essentially, everything will average out if you have enough data.

#### Part 2:<br>
The mean of all these sample means, will be the same as the population mean (as the sample size grows larger)

#### Part 3:

We use this clause to assume that the mean of our sample, should be somewhere in the bell curve of the population parameter.  (null hypothesis)
If this is not the case, then we reject our null hypothesis and can say our data is an outlier of sorts to the population baseline


# Hypothesis Tests
### One Sample
Used for when comparing a new hypothesis to an already existing threshold <br> <br>
__Z-Test for Population Mean__ <br>
Assumptions:
Random Sampling was used <br>
Population distribution is normal OR n >=30 <br>
Population standard deviation MUST be known <br> <br>

__Z Test for Population Proportion__ <br>
Assumptions: <br>
Random Sampling was used <br>
n*p>= 10 AND n*(p-1)>=10 <br>
If sampling w/o replacement, n is no more than 10! of the population size

__T-Test for Sample Means__ <br>
Assumptions:
Population distribution is normal OR n >=30 <br>
Population standard deviation is unknown <br> <br>

### Two Sample 
Used when comparing the performance of two samples/groups <br><br>
__T test for Comparing Two Populations__ <br>


Properties: <br>
* bell shaped and centered at zero (just like z distribution)
* each _t_ distribution is more spread out than the _z_ distribution
* As the number of df increases, the spread of the _t_ distribution decreases and the sequence of _t_ distributions approaches the _z_ distribution
  <br>
__Chi-Squared Test:__ <br>
To determine if the expected and observed results are well-fitted. Chi-square test analyzes the differences between categorical variables from a random sample. The test's fundamental premise is that the observed values in your data should be compared to the predicted values that would be present if the null hypothesis were true.

# Errors
Type I Error: alpha/significance level <br>
Type II Error: beta
Power: 1- (Type II Error): the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis<br>
<br>
Use the maximum acceptable value as the level of significance because using a smaller alphs increases beta.<br><br>
Variables that impact the Power of the Test<br>
The larger the size of the discrepancy between the hypothesized value and the actual vlaue of the population characteristic, the greater the power<br>
The larger the significance level, alpha, the grater the power of the test <br>
The larger the sample size, the greater the power of the test
